## R CMD check results

* I have amended my examples as requested in my previous submission. Please note, because this package interacts with a web-based REST API, there may be variance in the elapsed time of examples. In my experience, elapsed time is usually under 5 seconds for all examples, but infrequently runs over. There are no citations in my package description. Thank you for your help!
