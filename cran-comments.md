## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

* In this resubmission, I have amended my examples as per the feedback provided by Beni Altmann on 3/29/2025. I hope the results will be satisafactory. I will note, because this package is a wrapper for a REST-API, the time to complete examples varies due to rate limiting and network connectivity. I have had checks of identical code which complete all examples in time-elapsed < 5 seconds, and checks with time elapsed > 5 seconds.
