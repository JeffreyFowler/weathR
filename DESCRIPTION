Description: Quick fetching of NWS (National Weather Service) data from the NWS API. Users can fetch NWS metadata such as forecast zones and nearest ASOS/AWOS stations with functions like point_station and stations_near. Daily forecasts for points and stations can be fetched with station_obs and station_forecast. Versions of these methods are also available for lat/lon point data. Additionally, users can get active NWS alerts using the alerts() function. The package returns data in a sf (simple features) object whenever possible.
